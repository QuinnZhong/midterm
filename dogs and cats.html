            <h3> Why Dogs are better than Cats?</h3>
            <p>
                It's probably fair to say that even cat lovers don't love litter boxes. No matter how well you keep up with them, there always seems to be a lingering odor. Plus, litter often tracks all over the house. It's practically impossible to find a good place to put the litter box in a small house. Scooping the stuff is stinky and dusty. 
<br><br>
Dogs don't need litter boxes. They can be house-trained and most can stick to a schedule. They can use the yard or do their business during walks around the neighborhood. You only have to pick up the poop, not the urine the way you have to do with litter boxes. And as for the poop, you can simply use poop bags on walks and a poop-scooper in the yard. Cleaning up poop may not be fun, but many think it's the lesser of two necessary evils.

Best of all, the poop and pee happen outdoors, not inside your home!
